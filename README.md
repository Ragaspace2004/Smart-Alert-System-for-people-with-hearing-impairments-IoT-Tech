# Smart-Alert-System-for-people-with-hearing-impairments-IoT-Tech

This project introduces an inventive wearable alert system tailored to the
unique needs of individuals with hearing impairments and dual sensory loss. Incorporating sound sensors, microcontrollers, a vibrator, and a micro camera seamlessly
integrated with IoT technology, the project aims to create a wireless wearable device that
provides real-time notifications and situational awareness concerning visitors at the door. Key features encompass advanced sound sensing triggering haptic feedback, Morse
code-like vibrations for communication, remote door control via wearable or mobile app, and an inclusive feature for deafblind users. The project emphasizes an intuitive user
interface, power efficiency, and security measures, ultimately addressing accessibility
gaps in assistive technology. Through innovative integration and tailored functionality, this project strives to enhance the lives of individuals with sensory impairments by
fostering greater independence, communication, and security.
